# TrackATrail
Mobile Development - Android

Term 6 project.

Creative Android app assignment - TrackATrail (currently not on Google Play).

My group's app allowed users to record trails in realtime, allowing users to see the distance they travelled and save their favourite routes.
Users can create an account, edit their profile, create and save routes, and edit previously saved route descriptions.
